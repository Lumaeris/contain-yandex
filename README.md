# Yandex Container

**Prevent Yandex from tracking your visits to other websites**

This is a fork of [Google Container](https://github.com/containers-everywhere/contain-google) which itself is a fork of [Facebook Container](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook)

Yandex Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent Yandex from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use Yandex while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## How does Yandex Container work?

The Add-on keeps Yandex in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Yandex and deletes the cookies that Yandex uses to track you on other websites. 

Every time you visit Yandex, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to Yandex within its container.  When browsing outside the container, Yandex won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your Yandex identity.

## How do I enable Yandex Container?

We’ve made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install Yandex Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/yandex-container/). This will log you out of Yandex and delete the cookies it’s been using to track you.
2. Open Yandex and use it like you normally would.  Firefox will automatically switch to the Yandex Container tab for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of Yandex or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the Yandex Container

## How does this affect Yandex’s features?

Yandex Containers prevents Yandex from linking your activity on other websites to your Yandex identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### Logging in or creating accounts on other websites using Yandex

Websites that allow you to create an account or log in using Yandex will generally not work properly.

## Will this protect me from Yandex completely?

This add-on does not prevent Yandex from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. Yandex still will have access to everything that you do while you are on yandex.com or on any Yandex app, including your Yandex comments, photo uploads, and any data you share with Yandex connected apps, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your Yandex activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your Yandex settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for Yandex. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
